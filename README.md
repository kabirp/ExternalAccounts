# ExternalAccounts

1) Please see my GitLab Account from my employment at Irreducible

Namely I contributed to the Binius codebase (binius.xyz)
Here was my account: https://gitlab.com/kpeshawaria1

GitLab can be tricky and you cannot easily filter for commits by author for inactive accounts.
The easiest way to see my contributions is here:
